# Google Summer of Code with the City of Boston

Below, you will find a list of ideas we have for a Google Summer of Code contributors for the **summer of 2024**. Thank you for your consideration!

## Guidance for Applications and Project Proposals

You can find guidance for applications and your project proposals **[here](https://cityofboston.github.io/summerofcode/guidance)**.

## Ideas List for 2025

### 1. Interactive Curb Management Planning Tool

As our city navigates the rise of ride-sharing, delivery services, bike lanes, and evolving traffic patterns, the Boston Streets Cabinet faces increasingly complex challenges in optimizing our finite curb space. Traditional space-by-space planning approaches no longer suffice for managing what has become an intricate ecosystem of competing demands in our dense urban neighborhoods.

Boston's street planners within the Streets Cabinet currently face a significant challenge: while planning major street redesigns across the city's diverse neighborhoods, they lack comprehensive tools to understand and model how changes will impact the broader ecosystem. This interactive tool will help our planners to visualize and optimize curb usage across entire neighborhoods.  This tool will help city planners:
- Visualize current curb usage patterns across multiple Boston neighborhoods
- Model the impact of proposed changes on surrounding areas utilizing key planning metrics
- Analyze competing demands for curb space in high-traffic areas
- Generate data-driven recommendations for optimal curb allocation

We give this project a **medium** level difficulty. The project can be completed in **175 hours**.

This project requires expertise in web-based interactive mapping technologies and data visualization. The contributor should be comfortable working with spatial data and creating intuitive user interfaces for complex planning scenarios.

The mentors for the project will include key staff from the City of Boston's Office of Emerging Technology including one who served as a Google Summer of Code mentor at Code for America in 2011 and the City of Boston between 2021 and 2024.


### 2. Computer Vision Curb-Use Analysis System

The City of Boston's Streets Cabinet currently relies on labor-intensive manual processes for parking studies, where city planners walk Boston's diverse neighborhoods with clipboards, recording license plates at 15-minute intervals. This methodology severely limits both the scope and depth of curb usage analysis, providing only a narrow snapshot of parking patterns in our bustling urban areas.

Boston's Office of Emerging Technology, leveraging its expertise in municipal AI applications, has identified an opportunity to revolutionize how the city conducts parking studies. By applying sophisticated computer vision technology to analyze video feeds from standard cameras like GoPros, we can dramatically expand both the geographical scope and temporal range of curb usage analysis across Boston's neighborhoods while simultaneously reducing manual effort.

A Google Summer of Code contributor will develop a computer vision system that:
- Processes video feeds from off-the-shelf cameras to automatically detect and classify various types of curb usage across Boston's streets
- Generates standardized reports for the Streets Cabinet detailing parking patterns, turnover rates, and regulatory compliance
- Tracks multiple behaviors including parking duration, double parking, and loading zone utilization specific to Boston's unique urban context
- Aggregates data across multiple locations and time periods to create comprehensive parking studies for neighborhood planning

The technical implementation will focus on training and optimizing object detection models (YOLOv8  or others) for the specific challenges of urban curb usage analysis, with direct support from Boston's Office of Emerging Technology's AI expertise.

We give this project a **medium** level of difficulty. The project can be completed in **175 hours**.

This project requires experience with computer vision technologies, particularly in training and implementing object detection models. The contributor should be comfortable working with video processing pipelines and developing automated reporting systems.

The mentors for the project will include key staff from the City of Boston's Office of Emerging Technology including one who served as a Google Summer of Code mentor at Code for America in 2011 and the City of Boston between 2021 and 2024.
